# Final-Year-Project_Saeed
 The novel coronavirus disease Covid-19 that originated from China, has been spreading at exponential rate all around the world. There are limited number of Covid-19 test kits available in hospitals due to the mounting cases daily. Therefore, it is need of the hour to implement an automatic detection system as a quick alternative diagnosis option to prevent Covid-19 spreading among people. The goal of the proposed project called “Detection of Covid-19 Using X-Ray Images” is to develop an automatic detection system to detect covid-19.In this software, we intend to use the chest x-ray for the detection of coronavirus infected patients in an automated manner. This system will be helpful to hospital doctors for early identifying patients with high likelihood of Coronavirus.
